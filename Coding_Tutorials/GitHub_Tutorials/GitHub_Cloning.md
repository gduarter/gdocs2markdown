- [Cloning?](#cloning)

Below are instructions for how to clone a repository, thats GitHub lingo for making a directory on your computer that is linked to your repository on GitHub. Before you clone, you might need to consider Forking follow the questions belore:

- Did you create this repository?

  - Don't fork it

- Is this a repository for our group or the open force field group?

  - Don't fork it

- Is this a repository for another collaboration?

  - Are you going to make changes to the code?

    - You should check the owners development policy before you clone, you might need to [[fork it]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qdRfO4hkexBoxear9YPCUxfkwz0Luv0R3F3DF9zqF-c/edit?usp=sharing).

  - You're just going to use the code and have no plans to make changes?

    - Don't fork it.

- Is this a repository from a completely outisde group?

  - Are you going to make changes to the code?

    - [[Fork It]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qdRfO4hkexBoxear9YPCUxfkwz0Luv0R3F3DF9zqF-c/edit?usp=sharing)

  - Not changing the code:

    - You don't need to fork it, but you might want to consider downloading a specific version of the code rather than cloning a repository that is in development.

We have a file describing how to fork a repository [[here]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qdRfO4hkexBoxear9YPCUxfkwz0Luv0R3F3DF9zqF-c/edit?usp=sharing).

# Cloning?

There is a button on the top of your repository's webiste for "Clone or download"

<img src="./media/image1.png" style="width:4.96875in;height:2.21875in" />

- You'll want to copy the ssh key

- Move to your terminal and enter the command

  - Git clone \[paste copied key here\]

  - You should see something like this output:

<img src="./media/image2.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.29167in" />

This process will create a directory with the name of your repository, you can cd into it and then start [[working locally]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ivk_IHnZd862YWdlppmqpU_0VRKY9FbbAOZ-XNC-TN8/edit?usp=sharing)
