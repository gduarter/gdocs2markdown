README.md files, issues, pull request comments, etc. on github all use the mark down syntax for formating (it is similar, but not completely identical to the markdown used in jupyter notebooks).

This is a very helpful [<span class="underline">MarkDown CheatSheet</span>](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Below are a few of the most useful/common syntax used in our projects:

- Titles start with a "\#" the more "\#\#\#"s the lower the subtitle

- Indicate code with \`code\` or multiple lines of code with \`\`\`lines of code\`\`\`

- Make check boxes with "- \[ \]" at the beginning of a line (note the quotes are so a checkbox isn't created in github)

- " \*" or "-" makes a bullet point when at the front of a line

  - "- \[ \]" makes a checkbox and "- \[X\]" is a checked off checkbox

    - Note you can click on these, they don't appear like a \[ \]

- "&gt;" at the front of a line to quote something said above

- \[word to appear\](url) will make the "words to appear" be a link to the specified url

- \~\~Scratch this.\~\~ results in strike through

- italics \*1asterisks\* or \_1underscore\_

- bold \*\*2asterisks\*\* or \_\_2underscores\_\_

- \"\\\" allows you to insert any of the characters above, so if you want to actually show an underscore and not bold the text use \"\\\_\"
