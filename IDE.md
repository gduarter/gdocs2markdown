IDE stands for integrated development environment, that is the software you use for writing code, for example vim, xcode, atom, etc. Here is a list of free options that at least one person in our group uses. Feel free to add others and why you like them.

- [*VIM*](https://www.vim.org/)

  - This is a very bare bones text editor environment, there are plugins you can get for autocomplete or other features.

  - Their main website is a bit dated, but there is a lot on StackOverflow and other online discussion forums for all your questions.

  - Used by Caitlin, Guilherme, Dr. Mobley, Victoria, Jessica, Nathan, Sam?

  - Make sure your .vimrc file has all required settings, see Caitlin’s example file on github: [*https://github.com/MobleyLab/SharedScripts/blob/master/Caitlin/vimrc*](https://github.com/MobleyLab/SharedScripts/blob/master/Caitlin/vimrc)

- [*Atom*](https://atom.io/)

  - Open source IDE created by the github developers

  - Used by Dr. Mobley, Nathan,

- [*PyCharm*](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

  - Paid and free community version, a favorite of python programmers at OpenEye where Caitlin started using it.

  - It uses your python environment to allow for autofill including custom python packages, also includes spelling and **syntax** checking, and an easily customizable format for coloring and how to highlight errors.

    - This includes, sometimes helpful statements about why something is syntactically incomplete.

    - Note - the syntax checking and autocomplete work with your custom python environment so you have classes you’ve built or other people have in specified environment it will look for those as well.

- XCode

  - Common with apple users \[CCB\] - that’s all I know.

  - Used by Camila

- Emacs

  - This is another command line tool for simple text editting. \[CCB\] - that’s all I know.

  - Used by no one currently (I think)

# Most people use more than one:

Bigger IDE’s such as PyCharm and Atom aren’t practical if you’re only making small changes, so it is best to be familiar with a commandline accessible tool such as vim so you can make quick changes (this is especially important when working on green planet or other clusters since you probably won’t have access to your other tools). If you’re going to be working on larger coding projects however, a tool that comes with spelling/syntax checking and autocomplete will make your life a lot easier.
